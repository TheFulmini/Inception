# ----- Changes compare to default ----- #

# remove listen on port 80 section
# add ssl_certificate
# add ssl_certificate_key
# servername to 127.0.0.1
# uncomment PHP to FastCGI server section and change it like here https://medium.com/swlh/wordpress-deployment-with-nginx-php-fpm-and-mariadb-using-docker-compose-55f59e5c1a
# fastcgi_pass is key here, wordpress:9000 is our php-fpm container and its published port
# index.php added to index list is mandatory
